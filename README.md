## General Information
- Case study on Convolution Neural Networks and the name of the case study is Melanoma-Detection-Assignment.
- Optimiser used for testing the case study is adam and sgd but out of the both chose sgd cause it gave the best accuracy.
- Also faced the imbance issue but adjusted using augmentor library.
- Used learning Rate 0.001 and also went for two 4 convulution layer, one flatten layer and one dense layer.
- Didn't use any prebuild architechture like vggnet.

## Technologies Used
- Python v3.7.2
- Numpy v1.20.1
- Pandas v1.2.4
- Seaborn v0.11.1
- Matplotlib v3.3.4
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Augmentor

## Conclusions
- with 20 epochs after solving the class imbalance got 90percent accuracy and 83 percent validation accuracy
- with 50 epochs got 93 percent accuract and 84 percent validation accuracy.
- Got the above after balancing classes .If the classes are not balanced it resulted in overfit issue.
